# Gorgeous-Sandwish-Monolith-to-Microservices

This project was developed during my first semester in the Masters degree in Software Engineering.

As explained in the "About" description, this project/class main purpose was to initially develop a Monolithic Application using Spring Boot and on a second stage, to migrate the developed Service to several microservices. Another big concern for the development of this project was the concurrent writing of documentation on the decision making that the team followed using a set of patterns and best practices learned throughout the curricular unit.

- Part 2 -> Monolith and correspondent documentation.
- Part 3 -> Microservices and correspondent documentation.

**Heads up** - All of the documentation is written in Portuguese, my mother tongue.
